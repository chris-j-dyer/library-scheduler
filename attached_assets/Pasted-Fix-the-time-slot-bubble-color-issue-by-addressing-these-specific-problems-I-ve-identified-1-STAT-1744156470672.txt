Fix the time slot bubble color issue by addressing these specific problems I've identified:

1. STATE INITIALIZATION PROBLEM: 
   Add a proper initial state for reservations. At the top of your component:
   const [reservations, setReservations] = useState([]);

2. API RESPONSE STRUCTURE MISMATCH:
   The current code assumes a specific structure from your API. Check what your API actually returns by adding this logging:
   console.log("API response structure:", data);
   Then make sure you're accessing the correct property (data.reservations vs data.data vs data.results)

3. IMMEDIATE UI FEEDBACK:
   When a user clicks to reserve, update the UI immediately before waiting for API response:
   - In your handleTimeSlotClick or reservation function, add:
   
   // At the beginning of the function
   const currentElement = e.target;
   currentElement.style.backgroundColor = '#808080';
   currentElement.classList.add('reserved');
   
   // Then handle the API call

4. CONSOLE VISIBILITY:
   Add more console logs to track the exact flow of data:
   console.log("Current reservations:", reservations);
   console.log("Is this slot reserved?", isReserved, "for room:", roomId, "time:", timeSlotId);
   console.log("After adding reservation:", newState);

5. COMPARISON LOGIC FIX:
   Your comparison logic might be failing. Simplify it:
   
   const isReserved = reservations.some(reservation => {
     // Simple non-strict equality comparison with explicit conversion to string
     const roomMatch = String(reservation.roomId) === String(room.id);
     const timeMatch = String(reservation.timeSlotId) === String(timeSlot.id);
     console.log(`Comparing: ${reservation.roomId}==${room.id}? ${roomMatch}, ${reservation.timeSlotId}==${timeSlot.id}? ${timeMatch}`);
     return roomMatch && timeMatch;
   });

6. FORCE RENDER UPDATE:
   Add a way to force re-render after state changes:
   const [updateTrigger, setUpdateTrigger] = useState(0);
   
   // Then in your reservation handler:
   setReservations(prev => [...prev, newReservation]);
   setUpdateTrigger(prev => prev + 1);
   
   // And use updateTrigger in your component's dependency arrays

Focus on these specific fixes rather than trying to rewrite large portions of code.
